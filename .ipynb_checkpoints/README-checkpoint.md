# Credit Scoring Project

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for building and deploying a machine learning model for credit scoring. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment steps.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Store your datasets here.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation.
- **src**: Source code for your data processing and model building scripts.
- **models**: Save trained models here.
- **output**: Save results, plots, and other outputs here.
- **README.md**: Describe your project, setup instructions, and how to run the code.
- **requirements.txt**: List all Python dependencies.

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

### 1.1. Collect Data

Gather datasets containing financial and personal metrics related to credit scoring. Save them in the `data` directory. Example files might include `credit_data.csv`.

#### Factors Influencing Credit Score:

- **Payment History**: Timely payments on credit accounts have a significant positive impact, while late payments or defaults negatively affect the score.
- **Amounts Owed**: The total amount of debt relative to available credit limits. High utilization rates can lower the score.
- **Length of Credit History**: Longer credit histories generally contribute to higher scores.
- **Credit Mix**: A variety of credit types (e.g., credit cards, mortgages, auto loans) can positively impact the score.
- **New Credit**: Frequent applications for new credit can lower the score temporarily.

### 1.2. Explore Data

Use Jupyter notebooks for initial exploration and visualization.

- Create a new notebook in the `notebooks` directory, e.g., `eda.ipynb`.

### 1.3. Data Cleaning

Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the data.

- Create a script in the `src` directory, e.g., `data_preprocessing.py`.

## 2. Model Building and Training

### 2.1. Split Data

Split the data into training and testing sets.

- Create a script in the `src` directory, e.g., `train_model.py`.

### 2.2. Validate Model

Evaluate the model on the testing set.

## 3. Model Evaluation and Tuning

### 3.1. Cross-Validation

Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

### 3.2. Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimize model parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

### 3.3. Model Selection

Compare different algorithms and select the best-performing model.

## 4. Deployment

### 4.1. Create a Script for Prediction

Create a script in `src`, e.g., `predict.py`, to load the model and make predictions.

### 4.2. Develop a Simple Web Interface

Optionally, create a Flask or Django web app to provide an interface for predictions.

- Create a simple Flask app, e.g., `app.py`.

## 5. Documentation

### 5.1. Document Your Process

Write detailed documentation in `README.md` covering:

- Project Overview
- Installation Instructions
- Usage Instructions
- Data Sources
- Model Description
- Results and Evaluation

## 6. Testing

### 6.1. Write Tests

Create unit tests for your data processing and model prediction functions.

### 6.2. Test Deployment

Ensure your deployed model and web interface work as expected.

## Summary

By following these steps, you'll be able to build a comprehensive machine learning project for credit scoring, demonstrating your proficiency in data science, machine learning, and financial modeling. This structured approach ensures that your project is well-organized, reproducible, and easy to understand for potential employers or collaborators.
